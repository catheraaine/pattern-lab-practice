# Hey!
This is a Pattern Lab build for what will eventually be my new personal web page. [The full repo for that site is here.](https://github.com/catheraaine/new-site)

The PHP version of Pattern Lab is, at its core, a static site generator. It combines platform-agnostic assets, like the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)-based patterns and the JavaScript-based viewer, with a PHP-based "builder" that transforms and dynamically builds the Pattern Lab site. By making it a static site generator, Pattern Lab strongly separates patterns, data, and presentation from build logic.
